				<h2>APPROACH</h2>
				<p>Our approach is a simple one. Every single client works directly with Bill, meaning you have the benefit of an architectâ€™s expertise from beginning to end of your construction project. He listens carefully, makes sure he understands your tastes, and works constantly on your behalf to ensure those wishes and visions are realized- from initial design through to the day your home is complete. Most importantly, he is always there to provide solid, practical advice for any and all questions you might have, before, during, and even after you have moved in.</p>
				<p>Behind Bill is a network of professionals- engineers, interior designers, landscape architects, arborists- experts in their fields available (if needed) to guarantee the success of your project. </p>
				<p>We work closely with all the major municipalities in Southern Ontario, from Toronto to cottage country. We can recommend reliable and skilled contractors wherever you might be building.</p>
